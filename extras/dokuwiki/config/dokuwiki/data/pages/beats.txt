===== Filebeat * =====

===== Filebeat processes the file logs =====

Filebeat, together with [[logstash]], processes the file logs for [[elasticsearch|elastic]] that [[kibana]] displays

===== Kibana displays the logs =====

===== Heartbeat * =====

==== Heartbeat monitors systems. It used icmp, tcp or http(s) pings ====

Heartbeat is in a separate container, it tests the necessary ones before starting kibana and logstash, because it is sufficient
with elasticsearch. Metricbeat in the elastic agent requires kibana, so the Fleet Server starts only after starting Kibana and
its heartbeat is only used if the elastic synthetic police is set or another monitoring is manually set - it will introduce
the police itself

===== Metricbeat * =====

The stand-alone Metricbeat is intended to be monitored services that lack police integration such as Kibana, Elasticsearch and also so
that beats in Elastic-agent, Heartbeat or Enterprise Search are not monitored by themselves, which is shown in 'Kibana - Monitor the Stack'
in red or the service is completely missing (Kibana). When the integrations are completed and can be set in the agent instead of advice on how to turn on the service in Metricbeat, then a separate Metricbeat will not be necessary. In 'Monitor the Stack' is often advised:
'Monitor with another Metricbeat.' That's what this Metricbeat is for.

==== Metricbeat handles the metrics ====
