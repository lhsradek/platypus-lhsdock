====== Traefik ======

[[start|platypus-lhsdock]] with [[Elasticsearch|E]][[Logstash|L]][[Kibana|K]]

Traefik is installed on local url https://www.traefik.local

==== Settings for APM-server ===

In **traefik.yml**:

<code yaml>
tracing:
  serviceName: "www-traefik"
  spanNameLimit: 150
  elastic:
    serverURL: "http://apm-server.docker.nginx.local:8200"
    serviceEnvironment: "production"
</code>

{{traefik03.png?209x207}} APM will be displayed in
{{kibana10.png?linkonly|services}} and {{kibana12.png?linkonly|traces}} or in
dependeces

==== Classic entrypoints ====

<code yaml>
entryPoints:
  http:
    address: :80
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: https
          scheme: https

  https:
    address: :443
</code>

==== Entrypoints for APM ====

For APM if you want to have it in traffic. I have several on one server, for
each application, to test the settings in the policies:
<code yaml>
  http-8200:
    address: :8200

  http-8201:
    address: :8201

  http-8202:
    address: :8202
</code>
APM can also be on https, but I couldn't find a way to give
[[https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/observability/tracing/elastic/|traefik]] and
[[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/configuration.html#configuration-settings-apm-instrumentation|enterprise
search]] ca cert. So it is good to have at least one APM on http. Another option
is to have a separate APM for these two applications somewhere inside the
container and use
[[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/master/configuration-instrumentation.html|instrumentation
to APM]] with https. See traefik labels https://github.com/lhsradek/platypus-lhsdock/blob/main/compose/docker-apm.yml

==== Entrypoints for Fleet servers ====

For [[Fleet-server]] if you want to have it in traffic. Again, I use more of
them for different containers, although there should be one on one machine and
can be used by multiple agents. I tune the settings of each fleet server with
it. See {{fleet01.png?linkonly}}

<code yaml>
  https-8220:
    address: :8220

  https-8222:
    address: :8222

  https-8223:
    address: :8223
</code>

See traefik labels https://github.com/lhsradek/platypus-lhsdock/blob/main/compose/docker-fleet.yml

==== Entrypoints for Logstash ====

For [[logstash]] [[https://github.com/lhsradek/platypus-lhsdock/tree/main/extras/logstash|ports]]

=== syslog pipelines ===
<code yaml>
  tcp-access:
    address: :5000/tcp
  udp-access:
    address: :5000/udp

  tcp-error:
    address: :5001/tcp
  udp-error:
    address: :5001/udp
</code>

=== elastic-agent beat ===
<code yaml>
  tcp-elastic:
    address: :5044/tcp
</code>

=== classic beat ===
<code yaml>
  tcp-beat:
    address: :5045/tcp
</code>

It doesn't have to be in traffic if you expose the ports. This is useful if you
want to see in traefik log on intranet.
