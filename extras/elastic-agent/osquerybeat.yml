################### Osquerybeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Osquerybeat ######################################

osquerybeat:
#   inputs:
#     - type: osquery
#       streams:
#         - id: "99f11606-f884-46c7-9ceb-f002126c3514"
#           query: "select * from processes"
#           interval: 60
 
# ============================== Process Security ==============================
# Disable seccomp system call filtering on Linux.
# Otherwise osquerybeat can't fork osqueryd with error: Failed to start osqueryd process: fork/exec ./osqueryd: operation not permitted
seccomp.enabled: false

# ================================== General ===================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
# fields:
#   env: ${STAGE}

# ================================= Dashboards =================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

# =================================== Kibana ===================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:
  # Kibana Space ID
  # ID of the Kibana Space into which the dashboards should be loaded. By default,
  # the Default Space will be used.
  #space.id:
  #
  host: "https://kibana.${APP_HOST}.${APP_NET}:5601"
  # api_key: "${AGENT_API_KEY}"
  username: "${ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME}"
  password: "${ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD}"
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    certificate_authorities: ["${ELASTICSEARCH_SSL_CERTIFICATEAUTHORITIES}"]
    verification_mode: "${VERIFICATION_MODE}"

# =============================== Elastic Cloud ================================

# These settings simplify using Osquerybeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
#cloud.auth:

# ================================== Outputs ===================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://es01.${APP_HOST}.${APP_NET}:9200"]
  protocol: "https"
  # api_key: "${AGENT_API_KEY}"
  username: "${ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME}"
  password: "${ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD}"
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    certificate_authorities: ["${ELASTICSEARCH_SSL_CERTIFICATEAUTHORITIES}"]
    verification_mode: "${VERIFICATION_MODE}"

# ------------------------------ Logstash Output -------------------------------

# output.logstash:
#   hosts: ["logstash.${APP_HOST}.${APP_NET}:5044"]
#   ssl.certificate_authorities: ["${ELASTICSEARCH_SSL_CERTIFICATEAUTHORITIES}"]
#   ssl.certificate: "${LOGSTASH_SERVER_CERT}"
#   ssl.key: "${LOGSTASH_SERVER_CERT_KEY}"

# ================================= Processors =================================

# Configure processors to enhance or manipulate events generated by the beat.

processors:
  - add_host_metadata: ~
  - add_cloud_metadata: ~

# ================================== Logging ===================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publisher", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Osquerybeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
monitoring.enabled: true

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Osquerybeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
# is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
monitoring.cluster_uuid: "${CLUSTER_UUID}"

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

# ============================== Instrumentation ===============================

# Instrumentation support for the osquerybeat.
#instrumentation:
    # Set to true to enable instrumentation of osquerybeat.
    #enabled: false

    # Environment in which osquerybeat is running on (eg: staging, production, etc.)
    #environment: ""

    # APM Server hosts to report instrumentation results to.
    #hosts:
    #  - http://localhost:8200

    # API Key for the APM Server(s).
    # If api_key is set then secret_token will be ignored.
    #api_key:

    # Secret token for the APM Server(s).
    #secret_token:


# ================================= Migration ==================================

# This allows to enable 6.7 migration aliases
#migration.6_to_7.enabled: true
